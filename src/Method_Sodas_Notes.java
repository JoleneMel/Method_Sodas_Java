public class Method_Sodas_Notes {

	//The main method is where our tests for our methods will go 
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			//Soda = parameter
			//Cup = method 
			
			//Soda is a vague name for what we want in it, in Java you do have to specify what data type you will be using 
			//in this instance we will use a String 
			
			//Cup is like the function because it is taking in the soda aka parameter inside and serving it. 
			
			//soda is the parameter, but something like "Cola", "Root beer", etc are arguments, you can remember this because 
			//people may argue about what is the best soda flavor. 
			
			//For returns we have to add a sysout for it to show on the console properly 
		
		}
		//This is like someone telling you what the soda they would like to have 
		
		
		
		//Many programmers start with accidentally setting their parameter 
		
		//This sets the output to only print out one outcome, a method is supposed to be a tool or like a multi-purpose solution 
		
		
		//Multiple parameters? We are gonna go to a fancy soda place so they have flavors~ 
		
		//example where this is also set 
		
		
		//A void returns nothing, it stops within the console, so it doesnt have any data to pass on to anything else 
		//so below are some examples of methods that return data and the benefits of that 
		
		
		
		//Example of it being set too 
		
		
		
		//With returns we can pass on the data to different methods to add to them. 
		
		
		
		//So with returns we will call the previously made methods to make it easier for us :)
